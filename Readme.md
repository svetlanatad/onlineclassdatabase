How to run mysql or mariadb from console ? 

Depending on your package manager, first, emerge either, I recommend mariadb, itis a lot faster. 

Go to the installed directory, then,  

```
mariadb_secure_installation
```  
Follow the installation steps. After, login to mariadb console with

```
mariadb -u root -p 
```
or however else you named yourself, type your password and you should see a Welcome to MariaDB console!

How to run the sql scripts? Simply type in the console 

```
source /path/to/the/script;
```
Dont forget the semicolon in the end! :) 

I wrote all the queries in the same file but i have probably more than 10 queries, three triggers, one view and function. 

Thank you for checking out my project and thank you for the semester!
